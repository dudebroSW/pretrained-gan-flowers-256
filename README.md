This is a generative adversarial neural network I trained to generate photos of flowers at 256x256 resolution. Preview photos are available as well as log data from the training process. This is my first attempt using StyleGAN2-ada-pytorch. Results are okay, the quality isn't great due to the limitations of my machine. Links to some videos I have created with this project are below. The .pkl file for generating your own pictures is now also included below.
